## C++ Wrapper for SQLite (Cross Platform Embedded Database Library)

sqLITER is a simplified C++ wrapper to access the widely used SQLite database library which is written on a C API model.  Licensing is GPL Lesser (Library) License v3.0.  The name comes from the idea of it being even lighter; the intended pronounciation is "sqLITER -> seek lighter".

This wrapper preserves that basic call/return value API philosophy but will eventually raise exceptions as an option.

The intent is to provide the power of SQLite in a very accessible form that can have a user up and running successfully in minutes.

All of the source code, documentation, and technical information is here.  The [sqLITER project homepage](http://sqliter.org) will also grow over time.

A user manual, more thorough explanations of the design philosophy, and code samples may be found in the docs folder.  Documentation contributed by [Tim Marsolais](http://www.tmarsolais.com).  

This project grew out of personal needs; I hope that others may find it as useful.  Many thanks to the SQLite folks for their outstanding work!
